# Mazdas-Game-Database
A website connected to a MySQL database which stores and displays information about different Games that are entered into it.

In order to run this webpage and database I used xammp. When the database is set up you will need to run statements in the 'initialise.sql' file. As long as the webpage has the correct link to the database it should work fine. 

Here is a link to the website that was set up on AWS: http://ec2-18-204-17-67.compute-1.amazonaws.com (Currently having issues with the database, so if it is still not working you check out the youtube link below)

Here is a youtube link for a demo of the website: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ywHNq1TRiQ
